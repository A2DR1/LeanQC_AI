# Automated Lean Code Notes

## Possible Methods of Improvements (BrainStorm)
- Try different LLM models (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gro 3...)
- Provide a clear starting point (instead of nothing but prompt), such as clarifying mathematical model in lean first
- Share Mathlibs and Lean documentations
- Try LeanCopilot's model

## Test LLM Capabilities (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gro 3)
1. define Hilber Space
2. define Quibit
3. define Gates (Hadamard Gate)
4. define Tensor Product 
5. prove Non-cloning

### Test 1
Test with no supports

### Test 2
Define qubits for it

### Test 3
Feed documentations - How? (Lora)

## Log

### 2025.07.19
I gave GPT-4.5 and Google Gemini 3 different prompts that ask for proof of entanglement from different angle with different resources to start with, but failed. 
Tried three ways:
1. ask LLM to prove non-cloning
2. ask LLM to prove non-cloning human written proof
