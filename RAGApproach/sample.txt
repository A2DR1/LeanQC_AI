Title: The Basics of Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight into chemical energy. This energy is stored in the form of glucose, a type of sugar.

The process mainly takes place in the chloroplasts of plant cells, which contain a green pigment called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll absorbs sunlight and uses it to transform carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil into glucose and oxygen.

The general equation for photosynthesis is:
6CO₂ + 6H₂O + sunlight → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

There are two main stages of photosynthesis:
1. The light-dependent reactions, which take place in the thylakoid membranes and produce ATP and NADPH.
2. The Calvin cycle (light-independent reactions), which occurs in the stroma and uses ATP and NADPH to synthesize glucose.

Photosynthesis is essential to life on Earth because it produces oxygen and forms the base of most food chains.

Fun fact: Less than 1% of the sun’s energy is used in photosynthesis, but it powers nearly all life on Earth.
