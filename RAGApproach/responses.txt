Question: In Grover's algorithm, each iteration increases the amplitude of the target state quadratically in the number of iterations.

I'm sorry, but without access to the specific Lean-QuantumInfo repository and its structure, I cannot provide the exact Lean 4 code for the given statement. However, I can provide a general structure of how the statement might be formalized in Lean 4:

```lean
import QuantumInfo.GroversAlgorithm -- hypothetical import based on the repository structure

theorem Grovers_algorithm_amplitude_increase : 
  ∀ (ψ : Qubit) (n : ℕ), amplitude (Grovers_iteration n ψ) = (2 * n + 1) ^ 2 * amplitude ψ := 
  sorry
```

This code assumes that there are definitions for `Qubit`, `Grovers_iteration`, and `amplitude` in the repository, and that Grover's algorithm is implemented in a way that allows for the number of iterations to be specified. The theorem states that for any qubit `ψ` and natural number `n`, the amplitude of the state obtained by applying `n` iterations of Grover's algorithm to `ψ` is `(2 * n + 1) ^ 2` times the amplitude of `ψ`. The proof of this theorem is left as `sorry`.
