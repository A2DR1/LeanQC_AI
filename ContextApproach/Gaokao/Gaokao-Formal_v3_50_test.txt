[Question]: To treat a certain disease, two new drugs, A and B, have been developed, and it is desired to know which one is more effective.
For this purpose, an animal experiment is conducted. The experimental protocol is as follows:
in each round, two white mice are selected for a comparative test of the drugs' efficacy.
For the two mice, one is randomly chosen to receive drug A, and the other receives drug B.
After the results of one round of treatment are obtained, the next round of experiment is arranged.
The experiment stops when one drug has cured 4 more mice than the other, and the drug with more cures is considered more effective.
For convenience in describing the problem, it is agreed that:
for each round of the experiment,
if the mouse receiving drug A is cured and the mouse receiving drug B is not cured, then drug A scores 1 point and drug B scores -1 point;
if the mouse receiving drug B is cured and the mouse receiving drug A is not cured, then drug B scores 1 point and drug A scores -1 point;
if both are cured or both are not cured, then both drugs score 0 points.
The cure rates of drugs A and B are denoted by \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), respectively,
and the score of drug A in one round of the experiment is denoted by \(X\).
If both drugs A and B are initially assigned 4 points at the start of the experiment,
\(p_{i}(i = 0,1,\cdots,8)\) represents the probability that
"when the cumulative score of drug A is \(i\), drug A is ultimately considered more effective than drug B."
Then, \(p_{0}=0\), \(p_{8}=1\), \(p_{i}=ap_{i - 1}+bp_{i}+cp_{i + 1}(i = 1,2,\cdots,7)\),
where \(a = P(X = - 1)\), \(b = P(X = 0)\), \(c = P(X = 1)\).
Assuming \(\alpha = 0.5\), \(\beta = 0.8\), prove that \(\{p_{i + 1}-p_{i}\}(i = 0,1,2,\cdots,7)\) is a geometric sequence.

[Question]: Let \(\{ a_{n}\}\) be a geometric sequence with a common ratio greater than \(0\), and its first \(n\) terms sum to \(S_{n}(n\in\mathbf{N}^{*})\). 
Let \(\{ b_{n}\}\) be an arithmetic sequence. 
Given that \(a_{1}=1\), \(a_{3}=a_{2}+2\), \(a_{4}=b_{3}+b_{5}\), and \(a_{5}=b_{4}+2b_{6}\). 
Let \(T_{n}(n\in\mathbf{N}^{*})\) denote the sum of the first \(n\) terms of the sequence \(\{ S_{n}\}\). 
Prove that \(\sum_{k = 1}^{n}\frac{(T_{k}+b_{k + 2})b_{k}}{(k + 1)(k + 2)}=\frac{2^{n + 2}}{n + 2}-2(n\in\mathbf{N}^{*})\).
